🔍 New Power BI Project: Suicide Data Analysis in India (2001–2012)
 I'm glad to share my recent Power BI dashboard that offers a deep dive into suicide trends in India over a 12-year span.
📌 Key Highlights:
📈 Year-wise trends showing rising cases over time
 👥 Gender-wise and age-group comparisons
 🗺 State-wise distribution with interactive map
 📊 Total cases analyzed: 331K+
👉 Navigate to Page 2 by clicking on "Click to View Suicide Reasons by Gender" in the report.
 This section contains a scrollable table that lists detailed suicide causes for both male and female, highlighting major factors like hanging, poison consumption, and economic stress.
💡 Proud to share that I completed the entire visualization and dashboard design in just one day. This project helped me understand how data storytelling can make complex and sensitive issues more impactful and easier to explore.lling with Power BI.
